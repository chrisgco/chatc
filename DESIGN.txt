Project Design: Create an instant messaging server

Members: Kayla Sinoimeri, Chris Grant, and Sarah Joseph

On startup/login, the user will choose a unique username. When they log onto this server, they will see a list of who else is also
currently logged on. They will be able to select another username and open a chat with them (or if they have already chatted, they will
be able to see see their chat history.)

Techinical Design:
The main part of the project will be the chat server, which will use networking to connect to its clients, and processes will be used
to fork off children and execute commands. The files will be written in order to preserve the chat history.

The serverw will generate a folder for each user, which will contain separate sub-folders for messages, commands, and files. Data sent
through the progrm will be automatically placed into folder (organized based on user and data type). When a user connects the server,
it will check those folders and display any new messages/data sent.

The chat server will probably take 4 weeks.
